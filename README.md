# Triplet-Network-and-One-Shot-Learning
A triplet network is trained to learn a distance metric between dataset samples. The efficacy of random triplet selection and hard triplet selection is also explored when using this learnt metric on one-shot learning. The OMNIGLOT dataset is preprocessed and pickled as omniglot_test.p and omniglot_train.p.

Dataset is from https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot
